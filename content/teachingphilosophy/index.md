intro: "Teaching is the most rewarding pursuit in my life. It is not merely a career to me but a source of deep, personal fulfilment and healing. My passion for teaching began at the age of ten when I started teaching my younger brother. Ever since, becoming a mathematics teacher has always been my dream. As someone who struggled and grew through my own learning experiences, I know how impactful it is to create a space where students can feel safe, supported, and heard even when they make mistakes. In mathematics, errors are not just inevitable, but also a crucial step in the learning process. In my classroom, I aim to build a supportive, low-pressure environment where students can stumble, reflect, and improve. Just as important, I aim to cultivate a sense of belonging for all the students, whether or not they choose to continue in Mathematics. Some aspects of my teaching philosophy, as described below, are designed to help the growth of not only my students, but also myself as a teacher, and move forward together as a learning community."

  - title: "My super power - Ability to adapt my teaching methods to suit the needs of different students."
    description: "Working with my brother, who struggled with math anxiety while I found the subject intuitive and easy, taught me the importance of tailoring my approach to individual abilities and learning styles. This experience has shaped me and enabled me to effectively engage with a broad spectrum of learners, from those who fear mathematics to those who are eager to explore its depth. I apply my adapting strategy to two primary categories: the courses that serve students with minimal or no prior mathematical exposure, and the courses that primarily serve students with a strong mathematical foundation. While these help guide my planning, they are not rigid divisions, but rather two ends of a spectrum. In practice, every classroom falls somewhere in between, and I continuously adjust my teaching methods based on the specific dynamics of the group I'm working with.
