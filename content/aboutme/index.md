When I’m not unraveling the mysteries of knots and quantum topology, you can usually find me with a paintbrush in hand, exploring the colors of the world, or wandering through nature trails, camera in tow. Born and raised in the lush hills of Kandy, Sri Lanka, I grew up curious about patterns—both in math and in life.

Growing up in Kandy, the vibrant streets and quiet landscapes sparked my curiosity early on. I spent hours sketching patterns, watching the way sunlight danced through the trees, and noticing mathematical symmetries everywhere.

My passion for numbers and abstract thought eventually led me abroad, where I pursued a Ph.D. in mathematics. My research in quantum topology and knot theory brought me to conferences around the world, where I shared ideas, collaborated, and published my work.

Beyond equations, I immerse myself in art, photography, and hiking. These creative outlets allow me to slow down, notice details, and find inspiration that often circles back into my mathematical imagination.
