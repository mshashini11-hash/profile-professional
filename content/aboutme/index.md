<p>When I’m not unraveling the mysteries of knots and quantum topology, you can usually find me with a paintbrush in hand, exploring the colors of the world, or wandering through nature trails, camera in tow. Born and raised in the lush hills of Kandy, Sri Lanka, I grew up curious about patterns—both in math and in life.</p>

<p>Growing up, I spent hours sketching patterns and noticing small mathematical details everywhere.</p>

<p>My passion for numbers led me to pursue higher education abroad. During my Ph.D., I delved deep into quantum topology and knot theory, presenting my work at conferences and publishing papers along the way.</p>

<p>When not immersed in equations, I explore the world through art, painting, photography, and hiking. These moments of creativity often feed back into my mathematical thinking.</p>
