<p>
When I’m not unraveling the mysteries of knots and quantum topology, you can usually find me with a paintbrush in hand, exploring the colors of the world, or wandering through nature trails, camera in tow. Born and raised in the lush hills of Kandy, Sri Lanka, I grew up curious about patterns—both in math and in life. My early education there laid the foundation for a lifelong fascination with learning, creativity, and adventure.

Growing up in Kandy, the vibrant streets and quiet landscapes sparked my curiosity early on. I spent hours sketching patterns, watching the way sunlight danced through the trees, and noticing mathematical symmetries everywhere. These childhood moments became the seeds of my fascination with mathematics and creativity.

My passion for numbers and abstract thought eventually led me abroad, where I pursued a Ph.D. in mathematics. My research in quantum topology and knot theory brought me to conferences around the world, where I shared ideas, collaborated, and published my work.

Beyond equations, I immerse myself in art, photography, and hiking. These creative outlets allow me to slow down, notice details, and find inspiration that often circles back into my mathematical imagination.
