  <p>
    Born and raised in the lush hills of Kandy, Sri Lanka, I grew up curious about
    patternsâ€”both in math and in life. My early education there laid the foundation 
    for a lifelong fascination with learning, creativity, and adventure.
    I spent hours sketching patterns, watching the way sunlight danced through the trees, 
    and noticing mathematical structures in everyday life.

    <figcaption class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-2 text-center">
      Art has always inspired my mathematical imagination
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    My passion for numbers and patterns led me to pursue higher education abroad. 
    During my Ph.D., I delved deep into quantum topology, knot theory, and the elegance 
    of abstract mathematics, presenting my work at conferences and publishing papers 
    along the way. These academic explorations not only deepened my expertise but also 
    taught me the importance of creativity in mathematics.

      Hiking keeps me connected to nature and inspiration
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    When not immersed in equations, I explore the world through art and nature. 
    Painting, photography, and hiking allow me to slow down, notice details, 
    and stay inspired. These moments of creativity often feed back into my 
    mathematical thinking, reminding me that discovery and beauty go hand in hand.

  <p>
    Sharing mathematics through talks and videos allows me to connect with 
    a wider audience and communicate the beauty of abstract ideas. 
    I enjoy blending storytelling with visuals to make abstract concepts 
    accessible and engaging.
