intro: "When I’m not unraveling the mysteries of knots and quantum topology, you can usually find me with a paintbrush in hand, exploring the colors of the world, or wandering through nature trails, camera in tow. Born and raised in the lush hills of Kandy, Sri Lanka..."

<p>Born and raised in Kandy, Sri Lanka, I grew up curious about patterns—both in math and in life. The misty hills and vibrant streets sparked my imagination.</p>

<p>As a child, I spent hours sketching patterns, watching sunlight dance through the trees, and noticing small mathematical patterns everywhere.</p>

<p>My passion for numbers led me to pursue higher education abroad. During my Ph.D., I delved into quantum topology, knot theory, and the elegance of abstract mathematics, presenting my work at conferences and publishing papers along the way.</p>

<p>When not immersed in equations, I explore the world through art and nature. Painting, photography, and hiking allow me to slow down, notice details, and stay inspired.</p>
