      I was born and raised in Kandy, Sri Lanka, a city surrounded by lush hills and beautiful nature. Growing up in such an inspiring environment sparked my curiosity and creativity from an early age. I am proud to be the first in my family to attend university and earn a bachelor’s degree, making me a first-generation student. I completed my Bachelor’s with Honors in Mathematics at the University of Peradeniya with Academic Excellency award. Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. in Mathematics at Michigan State University.

      While mathematics is my professional path, art has always been a central part of my life. Whenever I feel stressed or immersed in complex problem-solving, I turn to my brushes and oil paints. Though I never took professional art classes, countless YouTube tutorials have helped me explore oil portrait painting and develop my own style.

      Outside of academia and art, I enjoy staying active with Zumba and other fitness activities. My family and my dog, Woofy, are my anchors—they inspire and motivate me every day.

      When not immersed in equations, I explore the world through painting, photography, and hiking.
