Quantum invariants were first introduced around 1980, gradually developing into a fascinating group of theories through the work of mathematicians such as M. Atiyah, A. Joyal, R. Street, L. Kauffman, A. Kirillov and N. Reshetikhin, G. Moore and N. Seiberg, N. Reshetikhin and V. Turaev, G. Segal, V. Turaev, and O. Viro.

The introduction of the Jones polynomial by V. Jones (1984) revolutionized knot theory.

$$\text{Example: } \int_0^1 x^2 dx$$
