> The whole theory has been, to a great extent, inspired by ideas that arose in theoretical physics... - Vladimir G. Turaev

Quantum invariants, founded around 1980 on the ideas of quantum groups and quantum topology, have grown into a rich area of mathematics through the work of mathematicians such as M. Atiyah, L. Kauffman, N. Reshetikhin, V. Turaev, and others.

## Project 1: Seifert fibered 3-manifolds and Turaev-Viro invariants volume conjecture

Here you describe **what you actually did in this project**. Include **math formulas**, **figures**, **links**, and **videos** as needed. For example:

- Explored Turaev-Viro invariants of specific 3-manifolds.
- Computed examples for Seifert fibered spaces.
- Verified relations with Jones polynomial invariants.

You can include LaTeX math like:  
$$
Z_{TV}(M) = \sum_{\text{colorings}} \prod_{\text{tetrahedra}} \{6j\}
$$

## Future Directions: Topics of Interest

Here you discuss **what you are interested in exploring next**. For example:

- Applying quantum invariants to low-dimensional topology problems.
- Connections between TQFT and quantum computing.
- New combinatorial methods for computing invariants efficiently.
