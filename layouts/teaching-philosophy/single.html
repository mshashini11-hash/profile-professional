        Teaching is not just a professional responsibility for me; it is a deeply personal
        and fulfilling part of my academic journey. I strive to foster an inclusive and
        engaging classroom where every student feels both supported and challenged.
      </p>

      <p>
        My teaching emphasizes adaptability: I tailor my approach to student needs, whether
        through technology, diverse assessment methods, or scaffolding complex material.
        I encourage collaborative learning and open dialogue, where mistakes are valued as
        opportunities for growth.
      </p>

      <p>
        Reflection is central to my practice. I actively seek feedback from students and
        peers, and I adapt my methods based on what resonates most. By creating a space
        where curiosity thrives, I hope to empower students not only to master material,
        but also to grow as independent thinkers and problem-solvers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ultimately, teaching is about connection. I aim to make mathematics accessible,
        relevant, and inspiring, while supporting diverse learners on their academic
        journeys.
